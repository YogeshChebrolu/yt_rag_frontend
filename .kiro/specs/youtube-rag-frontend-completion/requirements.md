# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the YouTube RAG Chrome extension frontend. The extension allows users to authenticate, chat with AI about YouTube videos using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique, and manage video processing status. The backend is already built and provides APIs for authentication, video processing, and chat functionality. The extension works as a Chrome popup that detects YouTube video ID changes through content scripts and provides a chat interface for video-specific conversations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with the extension so that I can access personalized chat history and video processing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the extension THEN the system SHALL display the authentication page if not logged in
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the chat interface
3. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL skip the auth page and show the chat interface
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the current video processing status so that I know whether I can chat about the video or need to process it first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a YouTube video THEN the content script SHALL detect the video ID change and send a message to the extension popup to update the context
2. WHEN the video ID changes THEN the system SHALL check the video processing status automatically
3. WHEN a video is not processed THEN the system SHALL display "Not Processed" status with a process button
4. WHEN a video is being processed THEN the system SHALL display "Processing" status and disable chat input
5. WHEN a video is processed THEN the system SHALL display "Ready" status and enable chat functionality
6. IF video status check fails THEN the system SHALL display "Error" status with retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to initiate video processing so that I can chat about videos that haven't been processed yet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the process button THEN the system SHALL send a processing request to the backend
2. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Processing" and disable the process button
3. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Ready" and enable chat
4. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my previous chat history for each video so that I can continue conversations and reference past interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches to a processed video THEN the system SHALL load and display the chat history for that video
2. WHEN the video ID changes THEN the system SHALL fetch chat history using the unique (videoId, userId) pair
3. WHEN chat history is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. IF chat history fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message but still allow new messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages and receive AI responses about the current video so that I can get insights and information about the video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message and presses send THEN the system SHALL add the message to the chat and send it to the backend
2. WHEN the video is not processed THEN the system SHALL disable the message input and show appropriate messaging
3. WHEN a message is being sent THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator and disable the input
4. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface
5. IF message sending fails THEN the system SHALL display an error and allow retry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my authentication state so that I can log out when needed and maintain session security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear the session and redirect to the auth page
2. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the auth page
3. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display user information in a profile section

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface so that I can easily navigate and use the extension features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, mobile-friendly interface using Shadcn UI components
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to the latest message
3. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and visual feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with clear actions
